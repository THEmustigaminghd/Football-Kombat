# Football Kombat

**Football Kombat** is a **prototype**, simple, concept arcade-style Pygame fighter where famous footballers in a character select screen are reimagined as Mortal Kombat-style fighters by the use of AI generated art.  
Pick your player from a 4×3 character select screen, hear the announcer call the name of your chosen character, and enjoy retro-inspired visuals and sounds.
